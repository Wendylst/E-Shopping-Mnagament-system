E-Shopping-Mnagament-system
===========================

We have created a Web application for Online shopping which offers products such as laptops, mobiles etc. We have maintained the relational database for the products in MySql server. We have worked on Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) Model and in order to eliminate the anomalies and redundancies in databases, we did some normalizations and decompositions to finally create an efficient, accurate database for this online web application.
The coding is being done in JSP(Java with Html) on IDE - NETBEANS.
